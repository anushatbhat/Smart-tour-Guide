# Smart-tour-Guide
Its a webpage that will help the tourists to learn about that particular place. In short it will act as an online guide.
Many people find it difficult to learn and have fun at museums. Reading long descriptions, especially those who find reading a challenge can be a drawback. We want to solve this problem and make visiting museums, zoo etc easier and more exciting. Right now, there isn't a simple way for visitors to get interesting information about exhibits without reading a lot. We want to create a device or system that talks to visitors, like a friendly guide. But, it should be easy to use, like listening to music with headphones
